# KittenWasagna

In this project You will get a:

1. .zip file with:
* .exe file with the program.
* .dll file for the program.

2. _data with my small Audacity record in case You may want to do a meme or whatever other funny
things You can think of.

3. .aup which is the audacity project that I recorded my voice through Voice Mod (Pro Version),
though an own created Voice MOD.

4. .mp3 (KittenWasagnaByLacucho) file with the recorded voice of mine through Voice Mod (Pro Version), through an own
created voice MOD.

5. .txt file with a manus from what it was said, written in my own languange that the whole project
was created from, "Kitten Wasagna" which is "OWO Languange" + my own version of "OwO and UWU -Languange" + "Bish Lasagna" name.

6. .mp3  (KittenWasagnaByGTTS) file with a bot reading the same .txt file but ended up being even a higher
failure and hilarious xD

I hope You enjoy this funny small thing! C:


How to:

1. Unzip the .zip file
2. If a folder wasn't create, then create one.
* I would recommend to call the folder something relevant (Kitten Wasagna) for example C:
3. Drag in .dll files in the folder and run the .exe file and enjoy its small content C:
